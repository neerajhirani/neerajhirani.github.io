**Note:** The below advice mainly holds good for mid to large orgs where multiple PMs handle different parts of a larger product (mostly in a B2B product environment).  

Most junior PMs gravitate towards focusing on execution. In large companies, their scope is usually limited to a feature area or a problem area or a segment. So in their mind, interactions with engineers, designers and data analysts form a major part of their job. Activities like sprint planning, scrum ceremonies, backlog management, priorities take up a major portion of their time.

PMs know doing discovery work through interactions with users, customers, and customer-facing stakeholders is important. However, it is very easy to get absorbed in the day-to-day minutia of work. These interactions tend to get easily sidelined. 

Every PM knows they should:
- Conduct customer and problem discovery sessions on an ongoing basis
- Have regular conversations with their product's users
- Seek clarity and align on business goals
- Get feedback from customer facing stakeholders
- Build relationships with team members, and
- Stay on top of what's going on in the market.

Left to their own devices, very few PMs make the effort to have these conversations consistently. Even if some PMs are having these conversations, they do so in isolation. This isn't improving the effectiveness of the team. 

Even within the Product team, if you’re not meeting regularly, you won’t be aligned. Feature dependencies across product surface late. Some PMs would have already defined priorities for their squads. Knowing all this hard work is wasted effort is frustrating. 

The Product team is a single organism. It should operate like one. It doesn't help if some folks are operating towards realising a grand vision while others are only thinking as far as the next release.

As a manager of Product Managers, one of the best ways you can help your team succeed is by adding guard-rails that can help all PMs in your team, new and experienced, function as one organism.

One place to start is by helping systematise their calendar. You can do this by setting an operating cadence for important meetings. This single action has streamlined so many things for us. We now work together as a unit, by combined action.

Given below are meetings we have with other stakeholder teams as a group.

All of these meetings are already on the calendar of all PMs in my team. It has helped us in many ways:

- **We move at the same speed:** We operate as one coordinated giant organism rather than individuals thrashing in different directions.
- **Building leverage:** Being around experienced SMEs (sales, marketing, support) helps build leverage. In each call, the PMs are looking at things from an SME's lens. They learn new things as a group and can then piece all the knowledge together. It gives them a far broader perspective than any SME and can easily counter any push back from any SME, say sales, by noting dev/design/stakeholder/customer needs. This builds up their credibility.
- **Being strategic:** We choose themes beforehand and come into meetings prepared. This leads to better brainstorming and collaboration. For the SMEs, they do not have to have individual conversations with product folks. Since each forum has focus, we get collective and contextual inputs from all members of those teams.
- **Unblocking teams:** Especially when it's about exerting influence on somebody who is not a teammate. Every time the blocker lies outside the PM's direct influence, or they need something to be done, discussing them on these group meetings help.
- **Better cross-functional collaboration:** Within product, we can now sense where dependencies arise faster and know which follow-up meetings need to happen between PMs / Engineers / Design and Data outside of these calls. When a squad is blocked, we can reprioritise roadmap items quicker and shuffle engineering capacity to meet important goals. Even externally, our updates on new releases, feature education or communication about delays go out to all stakeholders with a unified voice.

Below are examples of meetings that I advocate each PMs have individually or with their squads.

This method of operationalising meetings adds just the right amount of structure for the team and helps set up your PMs for success. Obviously, they still need to ensure that they're showing up, contributing actively, being honest about what they don’t understand, and being reliable. Through regular touch-points, your PMs can build up a positive reputation, and easily influence even without authority.

**Some more notes:**

- Since these are recurring meetings, we have attached separate google sheets in the invites for each of them. Meeting participants need to list out agenda items, questions, inputs and comments beforehand. This keeps discussions focused.
- Where it is needed, we try to send out pre-reads so that stakeholders can have richer discussions as everyone has enough context beforehand.
- We actively clear the deck of meetings we don't need. Sometimes we don't have new things to discuss. We are already aligned. On those occasions, we choose to cancel that instance of the meeting.
- All PMs have similar times at which "No meeting hours" are pencilled in their calendar.
