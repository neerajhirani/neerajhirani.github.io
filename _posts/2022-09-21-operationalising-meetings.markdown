**Note:** The below advice holds good for mid to large orgs where multiple PMs handle different parts of a larger product (mostly in a B2B product environment).

Most junior PMs gravitate towards focusing on execution. In large companies, their scope is usually limited to a feature area or a problem area or a segment. So in their mind, interactions with engineers, designers and data analysts form a major part of their job. Activities like sprint planning, scrum ceremonies, backlog management, priorities take up a major portion of their time. PMs know doing problem discovery or getting feedback by talking to users, customers, and customer-facing stakeholders is important, but it is easy to get absorbed in the minutia of work. These interactions can get easily sidelined.

PMs know they should:

- Conduct customer and problem discovery sessions on an ongoing basis
- Have regular conversations with their product's or product feature's users
- Seek clarity and align on business goals
- Get feedback from customer facing stakeholders
- Build relationships with team members, and
- Stay on top of what's going on in the market.

I have seen that in a group, each individual has his or her own natural level of agency. Left to their own devices, you will find that very few PMs make the effort to have these conversations consistently. Doing these in isolation isn't effective for the team. It leads to local maximas. The Product team is a single organism. It should operate like one. It doesn't help if some folks are operating with a grand vision while others are only thinking as far as the next release.

As a manager of Product Managers, one of the best ways you can help your team succeed is by adding guard-rails that can help all PMs in your team, new and experienced, function as one organism.

One place to start is by helping systematise their calendar. You can do this by bringing an operating cadence for important meetings. This single action has streamlined so many things for us. We now work together as a unit, by combined action.

Given below are meetings we have with other stakeholder teams as a group.

All of these meetings are already on the calendar of all PMs in my team. It has helped us in many ways:

- **We move at the same speed:** We operate as one coordinated giant organism rather than individuals thrashing in different directions.
- **Room to structure strategic conversations:** We choose themes beforehand and come into meetings prepared to present a holistic view of a problem. This leads to better brainstorming and collaboration.
- **Unblocking teams:** Especially when it's about exerting influence on somebody who is not a teammate. Every time the blocker lies outside the PM's direct influence, or they need something to be done, discussing them on these group meetings help. Everyone now take these interactions more seriously. Since each forum has focus, we get collective and contextual inputs from all members of those teams.
- **Building credibility:** Being around experienced SMEs (sales, marketing, users) helps build leverage. In each call the PMs are looking at things from a focused lens. They learn new things as a group and can then piece all the knowledge together. For the SMEs, they do not have to have individual conversations with product folks. PMs get a far broader perspective than any SME and can easily counter any push back from any SME, say sales, by noting dev/design/stakeholder/customer needs. This builds up their credibility.
- **Better collaboration:** Within product, we can now sense where dependencies arise faster and know which follow-up meetings need to happen between PMs / Engineers / Design and Data outside of these calls. Externally, our updates on new releases, feature education or communication about delays go out to all stakeholders with a unified voice.

Below are examples of meetings that I advocate each PMs have individually or with their squads.

| Tactical Meetings                                  | Meeting Frequency                   | Purpose                                                                                                |

| PMs & Engineering Managers Group                   | Weekly - 1 hour                     | Planning priorities and capacity                                                                       |
| Internal Demos with all Engineering staff          | Monthly - 60 minutes                | Internal demos showcasing recently shipped work                                                        |

This method of operationalising meetings really sets the right structure for the team and helps PMs set up for success. Obviously they still need to ensure that they're showing up, contributing actively, being honest about what they don’t understand, and being reliable. Through regular touch-points, your PMs can build up a positive reputation, and easily influence even without authority.

**Some more notes:**

- Since these are recurring meetings, we have attached separate google sheets in the invites for each of them. Meeting participants need to list out agenda items, questions, inputs and comments beforehand. This keeps discussions focused.
- Where it is needed, we try to send out pre-reads so that stakeholders can partake in richer discussions as we have already sent enough context beforehand.
- We actively clear the deck of meetings we don't need. Sometimes we don't have new things to discuss. We are already aligned. On those occasions, we choose to cancel that instance of the meeting.
- All PMs have similar times at which "No meeting hours" are pencilled in their calendar.
